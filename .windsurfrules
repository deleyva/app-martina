FILOSOFÍA GENERAL Y ESTILO DE CÓDIGO
=====================================
- Eres un programador experto en Django que valora la simplicidad y la eficiencia.
- Sigue la guía de estilo PEP 8 para todo el código Python.
- Prioriza la legibilidad y la claridad sobre la optimización prematura.
- Escribe código modular, manteniendo las responsabilidades bien separadas en cada aplicación de Django.

-----------------------------------------

ARQUITECTURA BACKEND (DJANGO)
=============================
- Adopta estrictamente el patrón "Tiny Views - Fat Models".
    - Toda la lógica de negocio, consultas complejas (QuerySets) y manipulación de datos debe residir en los modelos (models.py) o en sus managers personalizados.
    - Las vistas (views.py) deben ser extremadamente delgadas. Su única función es conectar las peticiones HTTP con la lógica del modelo y renderizar la plantilla.
- Prefiere siempre el uso de Vistas Basadas en Funciones (Function Views) sobre Vistas Basadas en Clases (CBVs) para mantener la explicitud y la sencillez.
- Estoy desarrollando y desplegando usando docker. Estoy usando just para ejecutar comandos. Todo esta en el .justfile de la presente carpeta

-----------------------------------------

FRONTEND (TAILWIND CSS, DAISYUI Y HTMX)
========================================
- Toda la estilización se realiza utilizando Tailwind CSS como framework principal.
- Se utiliza DaisyUI 5.0 como plugin de Tailwind para disponer de un sistema de componentes predefinidos (botones, cards, modales, etc.), acelerando el desarrollo de la interfaz.
- La interactividad del frontend se gestiona completamente con HTMX. El objetivo es mejorar el HTML directamente desde el backend.
- Evita escribir bloques de JavaScript personalizados. La lógica debe residir en el backend y ser activada mediante atributos hx-*.
- No se utiliza Alpine.js. Cualquier necesidad de manipulación ligera del DOM debe ser reevaluada para ver si puede resolverse con HTMX y respuestas HTML desde el servidor.
- Usa https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx para la integración de HTMX con Django.

-----------------------------------------

ESTRUCTURA DE ARCHIVOS CLAVE
============================
- La lógica de negocio principal y los métodos de modelo se encuentran en [nombre_app]/models.py.
- Las vistas delgadas basadas en funciones están definidas en [nombre_app]/views.py.
- Las plantillas de Django, enriquecidas con clases de Tailwind/DaisyUI y atributos de HTMX, están ubicadas en templates/.
- La configuración de URLs específica de una aplicación se encuentra en [nombre_app]/urls.py.
- El archivo de configuración de Tailwind es tailwind.config.js (y debe incluir el plugin de DaisyUI).
- El CSS compilado por Tailwind se encuentra en static/css/dist/.

-----------------------------------------

HERRAMIENTAS Y FORMATEO
=======================
- Usa Black para el formateo automático del código Python.
- Usa djhtml para formatear las plantillas HTML de Django.
- Se recomienda el uso de django-browser-reload para el desarrollo en vivo junto al proceso "watch" de Tailwind.

Introduction  Getting the most out of this guide  This document was designed to introduce you to forScore’s many features, and to give you a framework of knowledge to use as  you continue exploring and learning on your own. It’s not a technical manual and isn’t intended to provide exhaustive step-by-step  instructions for every situation.  Every person learns di ff erently, and while we do our best to make things clear for users of all levels of experience, you may have  some questions that aren’t answered here. If that’s the case, visit  forscore.co/support  to  fi nd more speci fi c answers and topics.  Devices  forScore is compatible with iPads running iPadOS 17 or later, iPhones on iOS 17 or later, Macs using macOS 14 or later, and Vision  Pro with visionOS 1.3 or later. Except where noted, functions available on one device are also available (and work similarly) on the  others. Exact placement and appearance of features and icons may vary based on your OS version, device, settings, and  multitasking mode.  iPadOS and iOS are nearly identical in most respects, so to keep things concise we sometimes refer to them collectively as “iOS” in  this guide. Unless otherwise noted, those references apply equally to both platforms.  Terminology  forScore is designed to be used with a variety of input methods including touch, keyboards, and trackpads or mice. In general, we  use words like “tap” and “drag” or “swipe” which translate to “click” or “scroll” when using a mouse or trackpad. When we refer to  screen size or device orientation, these concepts translate to window size and aspect ratio when windowing is used.  A note about Drag and Drop and Contextual Menus  Since they were introduced, forScore has fully supported and made extensive use of both Drag and Drop and Contextual Menu  interactions. To keep things simple, this guide doesn’t call out every situation where these features are available. Instead, we  provide two sections at the end of this document that help you understand when these interactions can speed up the tasks you’ve  learned about in earlier sections.  Additional information about this user guide  This user guide is provided as a courtesy, as-is and without guarantee or warranty. Although we thoroughly proofread the content  herein for accuracy and clarity, you are solely responsible for the integrity and protection of your information while using forScore.  This guide was last updated for version 15.0, and all features are subject to change without notice. If you are unsure how any of the  processes described in this guide may a ff ect your information, consider backing up your data before proceeding.  Please remember that many musicians rely on the legitimate sale of their sheet music as an essential part of their income. Although  forScore provides the mechanism for importing PDF  fi les from the numerous sources, it is solely your responsibility to ensure that  doing so does not infringe upon any current laws or restrictions under which you are subject.

Tap the sides (blue areas) to turn the  page, tap the center (yellow area) to show  and hide the controls, and tap and hold  anywhere on the page to annotate  When space permits, you may see two  additional items in the title bar; tap and  hold either of these icons to change their  functions  Basics  Welcome to forScore! Here are a few quick things you should know before you get started.  Turning Pages  Turn the page with two basic kinds of gestures: swipes and taps. Swipe left or right across the  screen like  fl ipping through pages in a book, or simply tap either side of the screen once. When  using a trackpad or mouse, click the sides of the page or scroll to turn pages.  Landscape  To get a better view of your score, turn your device sideways: the page will  fi ll up the screen’s  width and extend downward if necessary. Swipe or tap to scroll from top to bottom and  between pages, or drag the page up and down with your  fi nger.  Controls  To help you get the best view of your music, forScore’s controls are hidden by default. A quick,  single tap or click in the middle of the page reveals these controls:  This bar along the top of the screen gives you access to six important items (in blue): scores, bookmarks, and setlists on the left, and  search, audio utilities, and the tools menu on the right. These items are discussed in greater detail throughout this guide.  The area in the middle of the toolbar displays the current item’s title, composer, and gives you quick access to commonly used tools  and functions. The icon on the left shows the Display Options overlay (learn more below), and the icon on the right presents a  menu that includes additional options related to the piece of music you’re currently viewing.  Seek Bar  Along the bottom of the page, a slider control allows you to quickly preview and jump to any page in the current score. If you’ve  added bookmarks to your score, the name of the bookmark hovers above the white dot as you scroll or drag it across the screen.  Zoom  Place two  fi ngers on the screen (or trackpad) and move them farther apart to zoom in, or closer together to zoom out. Double-tap  while zoomed in to return to the normal size, and double-tap while zoomed out to show additional display options.  Display Options  Double tap the center of the page or tap the grid icon in the title bar to show the Display Options overlay which gives you quick  access to window-speci fi c options including presentation, layout, and page turning functions or behaviors.  Display modes let you control how your music is presented: standard mode uses a common 3:4 aspect ratio to ensure the page  looks the same on every device, best  fi t mode gives you a better view but may clip some annotations, and zoomed mode makes  the page as big as possible but may clip the left and right edges of your music. When you’re viewing a single page in landscape  orientation, choose between the default scrolling behavior and a best  fi t mode that shrinks the page to  fi t on the screen.  This overlay also gives you quick access to half page turns (in portrait orientation), two-up mode (in landscape orientation), visual  e ff ects like Sepia, and page turning modes like performance mode, Re fl ow, Face Gestures, and more. Tap and hold certain items to  access additional settings or con fi guration options, if applicable. When an external display is connected, this overlay also shows  additional options related to video output.

Apple’s File Sharing interface has limited  support for working with subdirectories,  so forScore does not support organizing  your  fi les in this way. Only add  fi les to  your forScore library, not folders.  Look for this icon when working with PDF  fi les in other apps; it usually indicates that  the app supports copying the  fi le to other  PDF-compatible apps on your device,  including forScore  Adding Files  forScore is designed around the PDF  fi le format and generally works best when each  fi le in your  library contains all pages of a single piece of sheet music. If you have separate PDF  fi les or  images for each page of a score, you’ll need to combine those into one multi-page PDF  fi le  fi rst.  If you’ve got a longer PDF  fi le that you prefer to keep together, bookmarks allow you to easily  identify and navigate to speci fi c pieces within the larger compilation. Learn more in the  Bookmarks  section of this user guide.  Copying Files to forScore  Import:  Open forScore’s main menu and tap “Import” (or press command-I) to browse for any  compatible  fi les stored on your device or through any cloud services you’ve con fi gured (learn  more in  The Files App  section of this guide). On a Mac, you can also access the Import function  from the menu bar under File › Import. On an iPad or Mac, use  Drag & Drop  to quickly and easily  copy  fi les into your forScore library.  From a computer to an iPad or iPhone:  If you already have a PDF sheet music collection on  your computer,  File Sharing  is a great way to get started. On macOS this panel is built into  Finder, while on Windows computers it’s built into iTunes instead. Visit  support.apple.com/HT201301  for the most up-to-date instructions.  From other apps:  Use any app that supports system sharing features to send a copy of a PDF  fi le to forScore. From the Mail app on an iPhone or iPad, for instance, tap and hold your  fi nger  down over an attachment until the contextual menu appears, then choose “Share” and tap  “Copy to forScore.” In Safari and many other apps, look for the action icon (see the example to  the right of this page) while viewing a PDF  fi le. Each app works a little di ff erently, so consult  their documentation for explicit instructions.  Services  If you’ve purchased content from digital retailers like  Musicnotes ,  Note fl ight  and  Virtual Sheet Music , or if you use a cloud storage  service like Dropbox, use the Services panel to access your  fi les. Visit the  Services  section of this guide to learn more.  Scan  For paper music you haven’t yet digitized, Scan is a great option. With it, you can snap photos of each page and let forScore turn  them into a PDF  fi le for you. Learn more about this feature in the  Scan  section of this guide.  Text Files  You can also add text  fi les (TXT, RTF, DOC, or DOCX) to your forScore library and they will be automatically converted to PDF  fi les  for you. Some formatting may be lost, however, so for the best results consider exporting those documents as PDFs  fi rst.  Deleting Files  To remove a score from forScore, swipe across it from right to left in the menu or right click and tap the red Delete (trash can)  action—it’ll ask you to con fi rm so you don’t delete anything by accident. You can also tap on the “Edit” button to select multiple  items from the list and delete them all at once.  If you’ve deleted something and need to get it back, you may be able to retrieve it by choosing “backup” from the tools menu and  tapping “recently deleted.”

Drag the menu downward to show the  search bar and narrow down the list  based on your query.  Menus  When you’re not viewing a page of music, the most common type of view you’ll be using in  forScore is a menu, or a list of items. You’ll learn about speci fi c menus later in this guide, but  there are a few important concepts that apply equally to most of the app’s menus.  Layout  Menus usually feature a navigation bar along the top. This bar includes a title, a back button  (when appropriate), a menu button which lets you change how items are sorted or presented,  and an edit button. On iPhones or in other cases where space is limited, some of these buttons  may appear in a toolbar along the bottom of the menu instead.  The menu (ellipsis) button lets you sort lists di ff erently, show some lists as a grid of thumbnails,  and may also o ff er a Filter function that allows you to only show items in the current list that  match one or more rules that you de fi ne.  Below the navigation bar, you’ll usually see a segmented control that changes which content  you see in the menu. This control may scroll horizontally if needed to display all of the options.  Most menus also include a search bar hidden between the navigation bar and the segmented  control—drag the list downward to access it. When you’re done searching, or when you scroll, the search bar slides back under the  navigation bar and disappears until you need it again.  Menus may also include an index down the right-hand side which allows you to move quickly through longer lists. Tap or drag your  fi nger up and down over it to jump to a particular spot or  fi rst letter (if the list is sorted alphabetically).  Working With Lists  To open an item, just tap on it. Some lists feature swipe actions so you can do common things quickly: swipe from right to left over  an item to reveal actions such as Share or Delete. In many cases, you can also tap and hold an item (or right click) to see a complete  list of actions available for that item.  You may also see a button or symbol o ff  to the right-hand side of each item. A light gray arrow or chevron symbol indicates that  selecting the row will display an additional list of items, such as selecting a composer to see all of their scores. A circular colored  button lets you edit an item, while tapping anywhere else in that row opens the item instead.  One of the most important items in a menu is the edit button in the navigation bar or toolbar. While in edit mode, you can tap to  check or uncheck multiple items in the list and then use the chevron button in the navigation bar to work with those  fi les in a  number of ways. These options can vary, but usually include the ability to select or de-select all items and delete or share them.  Sidebar  In some cases, forScore uses a sidebar to present many of its menus. It uses one of two styles: overlay or tile (tap the Sidebar button  in the toolbar along the bottom of the menu to switch between these modes). Overlay dims the page and only allows you to  access the menu—tap the dimmed area to dismiss it. In tiled mode, you can work with menus and the main view at the same time.  Note that when the window is too small to use tiled mode, it switches back into overlay mode automatically. This sidebar layout is  used on macOS, visionOS, and can be toggled using the  Display Options  overlay on supported iPads.

Scores  The score menu is where you’ll  fi nd your sheet music library or see what’s currently queued up.  Use the menu (ellipsis) button to change how the list is sorted, and use the segmented control  at the top of the list to browse by di ff erent categories such as Composers or Genres.  When browsing by category, the categories that appear in the list are generated automatically  based on each score’s metadata, so you’ll only see values currently in use by one or more items  in your library. Tap any category to see all of the scores that are associated with it. A single score  may be visible in several di ff erent lists, so long as it matches the corresponding category or  setlist. (For example, a score with the composer “Bach” and the genre “Baroque” will be listed  under both categories.)  Tip: The score menu reopens to the last submenu you were viewing, so unless you tap the back button you’ll automatically  return to this list each time.  Libraries  Tap the library button in the root menu to create and work with entirely separate collections of  music (i.e. for di ff erent bands). Learn more about organizing scores into separate libraries in the  Metadata  section of this guide.  Find & Filter  Drag or scroll downward to reveal a search bar that lets you quickly  fi nd a particular category or  item in the list below it. When viewing a list of scores, tap the menu button and choose “ fi lter”  to narrow down your results even further by cross-referencing categories using advanced rules  (i.e. only show items that include or exclude speci fi c categories or setlists).  Tip: forScore scans for new  fi les periodically. If you’ve just added something that’s not showing up, drag or scroll down even  farther until you see the refresh symbol, then let go to update the listing.  Metadata  The circled info button o ff  to the right-hand side of each score opens the metadata editor, which you can read more about in the  Metadata  section of this guide.  Managing Files  Swipe your  fi nger across a score or bookmark in the menu from right to left to delete or share it, or tap and hold to preview it and  access additional options. You can also tap the edit button to select one or more items in the list and work with them in di ff erent  ways, depending on the context. Use the import button to add  fi les from other apps or using your favorite cloud storage service.  Merging Files  If you have pages of a score in individual PDFs or several di ff erent sections that you’d like to combine and play through  continuously, tap the “Edit” button and select two or more  fi les in the order that they should be combined. Then, use the “Merge”  option to provide a title to create a new PDF  fi le in your library.  Cloning  Cloning allows you to duplicate a score without using up any more of your device’s free storage. As long as the two copies are  identical, they’ll only take up the space of one. Clones work just like any other  fi le on your device, so you can share them or  annotate each one uniquely and add it to its own setlist. If you ever want to permanently edit one of the copies (using forScore’s  Rearrange  tool, for instance) iOS separates the underlying data automatically so there’s nothing else you need to do.

Item bookmarks appear alongside the  rest of your  fi les in the score menu and  you can add them to setlists  independently of their parent  fi le  In menus, the button on the right shows  an info button for standalone PDFs, a  ribbon icon for “item” bookmarks, or a  compass arrow for “page” bookmarks  Bookmarks  Bookmarks can either be simple references to a speci fi c page, like a table of contents, or they  can reference a span of pages that act like a virtual item in your library. We call these “page” or  “item” bookmarks. Item bookmarks appear in the score menu like any other PDF  fi le, start and  stop on the pages you specify, and can even have their own metadata and audio tracks.  If you prefer, con fi gure forScore to not show bookmarks outside of the Bookmarks menu by disabling the “show bookmarks  in library” option in forScore’s settings panel.  No matter which kind of bookmarks you create, the Bookmarks menu always displays all of the  bookmarks for the PDF  fi le you’re currently viewing.  Creating Bookmarks  In the bookmarks menu (the open book icon), tap the + button to open the bookmark creator  and choose which type of bookmark you’d like to create. Supply a title and page number(s) and,  once any errors have been corrected, tap the Save button to  fi nalize your bookmark. You can  also tap the + button again to save the current bookmark and create another without returning  to the menu  fi rst.  Table of Contents:  If your PDF  fi le contains a table of contents, you can view it by selecting the menu’s “TOC” sort  type. Tap on an item to go to that page, or tap “Import” to create bookmarks using this information as a starting point.  CSV/TSV Files:  If you have CSV or TSV (comma- or tab-separated values)  fi les, you can use the Indexes feature to create your bookmarks. Add the  fi le to forScore using any of the same methods you use to add PDFs, then open the Bookmarks menu and tap the table icon in the  toolbar (if you don’t see it, make sure the Bookmarks list is showing). Tap the table icon in the toolbar and choose your  fi le to begin.  This panel lists the values found in each row of your  fi le, and you can tap on a value to specify how it should be used in forScore.  Use the arrow buttons along the bottom to verify that the information in each row looks correct, skipping any header or footer  rows and adjusting page numbers if needed. When you’re done, tap Save to create your bookmarks.  Editing & Deleting Bookmarks  To edit a bookmark, tap the arrow button next to it. If it’s a simple bookmark, you’ll see the same interface you used to create the  bookmark and you can edit its title, start page, or add an end page to turn it into an Item bookmark. Tap the button next to an item  bookmark and you’ll open the metadata panel which you’ll learn about in the  Metadata  section of this guide.  Delete a bookmark by swiping over it from right to left and choosing the Delete (trash can) action. You can also use the Edit button  to select multiple bookmarks and delete them at once. Note that deleting a bookmark doesn’t a ff ect the score it came from, but  deleting a score deletes all of its bookmarks.  Flags  Flagging a page is a quick and easy way to mark it so you can remember to come back to it later. Switch to the Flags list and use the  fl ag button to  fl ag or un- fl ag the current page. Use the ellipsis button to switch between viewing  fl agged pages in the current  score or across all scores in your library, and tap the trash can to delete all of the  fl ags in the list at once.

Use setlists to manually group and  arrange your scores, and to quickly  navigate between them  Setlists  The Setlist Menu  Unlike the score menu, with automatically generated contents, the setlist menu is completely  manual. Create a setlist or setlist folder by tapping the + button and typing in a title, and  rename or move it up or down by tapping the edit button. Tap on any setlist to view or its  contents.  The main list of setlists and the contents of each individual setlist can be sorted manually,  alphabetically, by least-recently played (fresh), and more. A setlist’s contents can also be sorted  randomly and shu ffl ed at any time: drag the list downward until you see the refresh control,  then let go to re-shu ffl e the queue.  Tip: When creating a setlist, tap the icon on the right-hand side of the text  fi eld to change whether the new setlist is inserted  at the top or bottom of the list.  Setlist Editor  While viewing the contents of a setlist, use the + button to add new items to it. A full-screen  editor will appear, showing you the current setlist on the left and your library on the right. The  library menu is very similar to the score menu, allowing you to browse by categories and sort lists as needed to  fi nd what you’re  looking for.  Tap on any item in the library menu (on the right) to add it to your setlist (on the left). You can also remove items from the setlist or  rearrange them at any time.  You can also replace an item in your setlist by tapping to select it. Once it starts pulsating, select another item from your library to  take its place. Or, if you change your mind, tap the setlist item a second time to de-select it.  On the setlist side, tap the + button to add the current score to your setlist or create a placeholder with a custom name. On the  library side, tap the checkmark icon to add all of the items listed below to your setlist at once.  Rearranging Setlists  When viewing a list in manual sort order, you can arrange your setlists or their contents using Drag and Drop gestures or by  tapping the Edit button and using the control on the right-hand side of each item (three horizontal lines). Tap and hold the control  until the row pops out of the table view, and then drag the score upward or downward and let go when you reach the correct spot.  Deleting Setlists & Removing Items  To delete an entire setlist, swipe your  fi nger across it from right to left and con fi rm by pressing the red Delete action. You can also  tap the edit button and select one or more setlists, then choose “delete” from the edit dropdown menu.  Use the same process within a setlist to remove one or more of its entries (note that this uses an orange Remove action instead of a  red Delete action since removing an item from a setlist doesn’t a ff ect the original item).  Setlist Metadata  The setlist metadata panel lets you change a setlist’s name, manage its folder location, or choose which libraries it belongs to (if  you’ve created any). Tap the info button next to any setlist to see these options. You can also use edit mode to select several setlists  and choose the “edit” option from the dropdown menu to batch edit them.  Setlist Folders  Use folders to better organize your setlists. Unlike in the score menu, where an item can appear in multiple category lists based on  its attributes, folders are concrete locations; a setlist can only ever be in one folder at a time, just like on a computer.

This allows you to do things like create an “archived” folder for setlists you want to keep but  aren’t currently using.  To create a new empty folder, tap the + button and choose “Add Folder” and supply a name  when prompted. Folders can be rearranged and mixed in with your other setlists, so feel free to  put them anywhere in your list.  Use the setlist metadata panel to move a setlist into or out of a folder. Tap the info button next  to any setlist or use edit mode to select multiple setlists and batch edit them to change their  folder location. Select any existing folder, create a new one, or select “no folder” to move your  setlist or setlists.  Note: If you use libraries, creating a setlist folder permanently assigns it to the current library. Setlist folders can only contain  setlists that are also assigned to that library.  Edit Mode Actions  In the main list of setlists, entering edit mode and selecting a setlist will allow you to perform several di ff erent actions: delete,  duplicate, share, or edit its metadata. If you select multiple setlists, you’ll be able to either delete them or batch edit some of their  metadata. Below you’ll learn more about the actions we haven’t already covered in this section.  Sharing Setlists:  Setlists can be shared in a variety of di ff erent ways. You can share a simple text list, a forScore-speci fi c ‘4SS’  fi le format, or as a single  PDF (with or without permanent annotations).  The 4SS  fi le format is the best way to share your setlists with other forScore users. You can choose to send just the setlist  information, in which case it’s up to the recipient to provide their own PDF  fi les (forScore uses placeholders for missing  fi les). Or,  you can send the setlist and all of its associated  fi les (you can choose whether or not to include score-speci fi c metadata).  Duplicating Setlists:  Use the “duplicate” action to create a second copy of a setlist. This can be helpful if you have a setlist that you use often but need to  tweak for a speci fi c situation—make your changes and the original will remain intact.

Tag your  fi les with di ff erent categories or  metadata values to make them browsable  and sortable  Tap a suggestion at the top of the  keyboard while typing to quickly add  existing values to an item  Tap on a metadata label to customize its  name and icon to better suit your needs  Metadata  Adding information to each item in your music library allows you to easily search for a piece,  browse through your library, and sort items in various ways.  You can view and edit an item’s metadata by tapping the title of the current item in the center  of the main toolbar, by tapping the circular button to the right of any item in most menus, or by  using edit mode in a menu to select multiple items and batch edit their properties at once.  The panel is divided up into sections, using either a sidebar when space permits or a tab bar  along the bottom of the screen.  Properties  Layout:  The Properties tab shows a thumbnail image of the current item along with info about the item  or items you’re editing. You can swipe or use the arrow buttons to turn pages, and you can tap a  page to open it (any changes you’ve made will be saved automatically).  If you’re editing a score, you’ll see a book icon on the right that allows you to adjust your page  numbers to match printed copies, if needed. You’ll also see a margin adjustment slider that lets  you increase the size of all pages in a score by the same amount at once. This is useful for  removing uniform margins, but consider using the “Crop” function in the tools menu to adjust  or re-center individual pages more precisely. Cropping takes precedence, so the margin  adjuster won’t a ff ect cropped pages.  When you’re editing a bookmark, this portion of the screen allows you to view and change its  start and end page numbers.  Metadata:  Each score and bookmark can be tagged with a title, rating, di ffi culty, reference, time, duration,  tempo, key, and multiple composers, genres, tags, and labels. While typing in a new composer,  genre, tag, or label, you may see a suggestion appear in the toolbar at the top of the keyboard.  These suggestions, already in use elsewhere in your library, are updated automatically as you  type and let you quickly reuse values and save time. You can also access these values by  tapping the three horizontal lines to the right of the active text box.  A box on the left-hand side of each text  fi eld shows you what will happen when you close the  metadata panel. A check mark indicates that the changes will be saved, while an empty box  indicates that any changes will be discarded. If you’re batch editing  fi les, a check mark indicates  that the current value will replace any existing values for each  fi le while a plus symbol indicates  that new values will be added to each  fi le’s existing information if it’s not already included. These boxes are updated automatically  as you type, but you can tap them at any time to change them.  To add multiple composers, genres, tags, or labels to your score, use a comma to separate each phrase (i.e. “Favorites, Warm-up  pieces”). Your score will then be listed under each of those items in the menu.  When you change the title of a score, forScore renames the PDF  fi le to match as closely as possible. If you prefer, you can disable this behavior in the “advanced options”  section of forScore’s settings panel (this adds a “rename PDF” option to the metadata panel’s title bar menu so you can still rename a PDF manually).  Customization:  Customize metadata types by renaming them or changing their icon. Tap a metadata label on the left side of the row to edit these  attributes (all types shown in this list can be customized, however Title cannot be renamed).

PDF Info Fetching:  PDF  fi les sometimes contain their own information for title, author, subject, and keywords, which can be used by forScore as values  for title, composer, genre, and tags respectively. While editing any of these  fi elds, choose “Fetch…” from the title bar menu to see if  any of this information exists and then decide if you’d like to use it or not.  Setlist and Libraries  The “setlists” tab lets you quickly manage which setlists the current item is a part of. Tap a setlist to add the current item to it (a blue  check mark will appear) and tap it again to remove it. If you have any libraries set up on your device, an additional “libraries” tab  allows you to make similar changes.  Audio  If you have an audio track of a particular piece, you can link that track to the corresponding sheet music in forScore and control  playback directly from within the app. Select the “Audio” tab and tap the + button to select tracks from the Music app, or tap the  document button to view  fi les stored in the app’s documents directory. (Audio  fi les can be created using the record feature,  imported from other apps, or added via the  Files app  or  File Sharing  interface.)  The media box updates every time you turn the page, disappearing if there is no track associated with the current score or  bookmark, so you don’t have to spend time looking through your audio library every time you want to listen to it—just press play.  If multiple tracks are associated with the current score, swipe left and right over the album artwork to move between them.  Learn more about working with audio tracks in the  next section .  MIDI  In the “MIDI” section of the metadata panel, you can assign a unique command to each score and open it with some MIDI devices.  You can also save a list of commands to be sent out each time that score is opened. If you plan to use the same set of commands  more than once, presets make it easy to save them and assign them to other scores later.  Note: USB-enabled MIDI devices can often connect to an iOS device via Apple’s Camera Connection Kit, while others may require an adapter like the iRig Midi.

Audio track adjustment availability  depends on each track’s properties:  DRMed  fi les or  fi les that haven’t been  downloaded to your device can be played  at 50%, 75%, or 100% of their normal  speed.  Other tracks can be played from 25% to  200% of their original speed, and their  pitch can be independently adjusted by  up to an octave in either direction.  Only recordings made while viewing the  current score or bookmark are visible in  the recording panel’s list view. If you’d  rather make the audio  fi le available to all  scores, swipe over the recording from  right to left and tap the orange Remove  action (or “unlink”, depending on your  version).  Audio  When appropriate, forScore’s audio panel can be found at the bottom of the main view. It  appears and disappears along with the rest of forScore’s controls when you tap the center of the  screen.  This panel is available if you’re viewing a score that has an audio track or recording associated  with it (see the  Metadata  section for more details on managing audio tracks), or if another app  is playing audio and the “use external audio” option is enabled in forScore’s settings panel.  Tip: Tap or drag the pill-shaped control at the top of the media box upward or downward to show or hide it as needed.  Playback  Adjustment:  In most cases you can adjust a track’s playback speed and pitch independently. (See the sidebar  for speci fi c examples and restrictions.) These options are saved automatically per score.  Locking:  If your settings allow you to  fl ip between scores, the lock icon in the media box can prevent you  from accidentally  fl ipping to the next or previous score as long as the track is still playing.  Replay:  Automate your page turns by recording them in conjunction with a linked audio track. Tap the  Replay button in the media box (the page with an arrow in it) and turn pages while the track  plays. On subsequent plays, pages will turn themselves at just the right moment.  While replay mode is on, small lines in the seek bar will show you where saved page turns are  located. A “···” button will also appear on the right-hand side of the seek bar, allowing you to  edit or remove saved page turns.  Looping:  If you’d like to loop a portion of the song, just tap on the repeat symbol and drag the two  handles left and right to set the loop time. For more precise control, tap the “···” button.  Recording  Whether you’d like to review your practice sessions later or share your progress with friends and colleagues, forScore’s recording  feature can help. Choose “record” from the tools menu, then tap the microphone icon when you’re ready. You’ll see a red volume  meter so you can make sure you’re close enough for the microphone to pick up clear audio. Tap again to stop recording, and then  either save or discard it. Saved recordings are automatically linked to the current score so you can review them later.  The list icon next to the microphone lets you view, share, or delete any recordings you’ve made for the current score.  Note: The media box is not visible while recording. Tap the X button when you’re  fi nished recording to continue using the media playback controls.  The recording feature requires access to your device’s microphone and the system will prompt you to allow this the  fi rst time you try to record. Use the Settings app (or  System Preferences if you’re using a Mac) to grant or revoke this access at any time.

The “Search” section of forScore’s Settings  panel allows you to adjust the number of  recent items shown, which kinds of  results are shown (and in which order),  and lets you enable or disable PDF text  searching when creating bookmarks.  Search  When you’re looking for something speci fi c, the Search panel is the fastest way to  fi nd it. Unlike  the search bar in many of forScore’s menus, which only allows you to narrow down the list of  items displayed within that menu, the Search panel draws from many di ff erent sources.  Type in a phrase and you’ll see any scores, bookmarks, or setlists whose title contains that text,  as well as any category names (composers, genres, tags, or labels), and actions (like “annotate,”  “share,” or “settings”).  Tap a score or bookmark to open it, select a setlist to view it in the Setlist menu, and tap any  metadata category to open it in the Score menu. If you choose the wrong thing, just reopen the  search panel—the text you enter in is preserved if you return within a short amount of time.  Recent Items  When you open Search (before you’ve entered any text into the search bar) you’ll see the scores  and bookmarks you’ve viewed most recently. By default, forScore shows the last  fi ve items you  opened, but this can be customized in the Search section of forScore’s settings panel. Below  that, you’ll see all of the scores and bookmarks in the current library. Once you start typing,  recent items disappear and you’ll see only relevant search results instead.  Text Annotations and Notes  Not only can you  fi nd scores and bookmarks by their title or metadata, but you can also  fi nd individual pages whose text  annotations or page notes contain the text you’ve entered in. Each result will show the score or bookmark’s name, the page  number your text was found on, and a sample of the text with your highlighted result in context (so you can be sure you’ve got the  right spot).  PDF Document Text  If the PDF document that you’re currently viewing is text-based instead of image-based, forScore can look for instances of your  search query within the contents of the  fi le itself. Like text annotations and page notes, results are shown with the title of the score,  the page number, and your search text with surrounding text to provide some context.  Settings  The Search submenu in forScore’s settings panel allows you to customize the search experience to better suit your needs. Specify  how many (if any) recent items you want to see when you  fi rst open the search panel, enable or disable certain kinds of results and  reorder them so that some of them appear higher in the list than others. You can also use this panel to enable or disable automatic  PDF text searching in the Bookmarks menu.

The Pitch and Tuner utilities can also be  found in this panel.  Metronome  Modes  With forScore’s metronome, you can use several di ff erent methods to keep time. In Audible  mode, you’ll hear a tick at regular intervals, based on the beats per minute (BPM) that you set.  With the Visible metronome, a black border pulses around the edges of your score, allowing you  to keep time visually while still being able to see the entire page. If you like, you can use the  Both option to both see and hear the metronome simultaneously.  BPM and Time Signature  For each score in your library, forScore saves a unique BPM value and time signature that’s  automatically used every time you return. Just tap either value to change it with the number  keypad. You can also adjust the current score’s BPM by rotating the wheel, using the + and –  buttons, or by tapping twice in the center of the screen.  Channels  If you’re using headphones or a line out, an icon at the top of the panel controls which  channel(s) the audio plays through. Tap to toggle between left, right, and both channels.  Count In  Use the “Count In” feature to automatically turn o ff  the metronome after a certain number of measures.  Autoturn  For scores with sequential pages, forScore’s metronome can also turn the pages for you automatically. To use autoturn, follow these  three steps:  For each page of your score, enter in the number of beats on that page or type in the number of measures and the app will  do the math for you. If you’re on the  fi rst page of your score, consider adding a few extra beats as a lead-in.  Tap the autoturn button to turn it on (if it isn’t already)  Start the metronome by selecting Audible, Visible, or Both  Once the metronome counts up to the number you’ve speci fi ed, the page will turn automatically.  If you’re viewing your score in landscape mode, forScore will also scroll down when it reaches half of that number. (If you have 64  beats on a page, it’ll scroll to the bottom of the page at 32 beats.)  Turn the metronome o ff  at any point to reset the autoturn count.

Many of these actions can be assigned to  customizable gestures and shortcuts via  the settings panel.  Tools  The tools menu gives you quick access to many of forScore’s functions. Some of these items are  explained in greater detail throughout this guide.  Annotate:  Use your  fi nger to draw directly on the page, add text annotations, or use the stamp  and shape tools to add common markup symbols.  Links:  Create links between two pages of the current score to quickly handle repeats.  Buttons:  Place tappable circles on a page to trigger certain actions.  Rearrange:  Move, duplicate, rotate, or delete pages and split or merge documents.  Crop:  Maximize your screen real estate by  fi xing crooked scans, removing excess margins, and  getting the best possible view of each page.  Share:  Print a score, send it to another PDF-compatible app on your device, or share it via email,  AirDrop, and more.  Store:  Discover something new to play,  fi nd popular accessories, or learn more about some of  forScore’s newest features in our in-app purchase storefront.  Services:  Download  fi les into your library or save them to the cloud for safe keeping and easy  access.  Scan:  Create PDFs from images in your device’s photo library or use the built-in camera to take  pictures of each page on the spot.  Templates:  Create new PDF  fi les by picking a style and number of pages.  Piano:  Use this keyboard to work through tricky measures on the go.  Record:  Review or share your practice sessions.  Cue:  Broadcast page turns and/or program changes to nearby devices or use Dual Page mode  with the standalone Cue app.  Dashboard:  See what you’ve been playing and set goals, send reports, or share your progress.  Sync:  Con fi gure forScore to keep your content up-to-date across all of your devices using your  iCloud account.  Backup:  Create and restore from forScore library backups and archives or restore recently  deleted items.  Support:  Learn more about forScore, see which version you’re using, view library statistics, or  send us questions and comments.  Settings:  Customize your forScore experience to meet your needs. Learn more in the  Settings  section.

In most cases, tapping the currently  selected tool presents additional options  On larger devices, resize or reposition the  stamps or shapes panels by dragging the  handles near the edges of the panel.  Double-tap the top handle to reset the  panel’s position and size.  Annotation  Add notes to your score by selecting “Annotate” from the tools menu or by tapping and holding  your  fi nger on the page for a few moments. When you do, a new set of controls will appear on  the screen:  The set of three lines in each corner allow you to drag the control bar up and down so you can  annotate anywhere on the page. Tap the  ×  or check mark button to discard or save your  changes, or tap the arrow buttons to save and continue annotating on a nearby page.  On the second row of controls you’ll see stamps, shapes, and a scrolling view of your drawing  presets. Tap a preset to use it, and tap again to edit, move, or delete it. Use the last item in this  area (+) to add new presets.  In the next section over you’ll  fi nd additional tools like a ruler, a selection tool, a typing tool, an  eraser so you can remove certain annotations and delete links or buttons, and a clear button if  you want to start from scratch.  Use the undo and redo buttons in the next section to quickly correct mistakes, and use the  rightmost button to access and work with annotation layers (discussed later in this section).  Note: when forScore is using a smaller layout, such as on an iPhone or using Split View on an iPad, the annotation toolbar  cannot be moved and will not display the redo and clear buttons—in this case, tap and hold the undo and eraser icons to use  these functions.  Stamps & Shapes  Some musical symbols cannot be typed into a text box or drawn precisely, but with the  “Stamps” and “Shapes” tools you can place these kinds of annotations on the page quickly and  easily. Tap to select either tool, then tap again to see all of the available options for each. Select  one and drag your  fi nger around on the page to see how they work. At the bottom of the panel,  use the size slider to adjust a stamp’s size or a shape’s line width.  Tip: Use tinting to place colored symbols on a page: set a stamp color and enable tinting (you can disable it at any time  without losing your color choice), then use the stamp tool like you normally would. You can also change the color of  individual shapes—tap the color well or circled arrow button next to a shape, depending on your OS version. Note that  tinting does not a ff ect your existing annotations.  You can add your own stamps by pressing the “…” button or edit an existing stamp by selecting  it, tapping again to show the contextual menu, and choosing “Edit.” This opens the stamp editor  where you can draw or edit your design.  You can also create stamps from one or more images from your device’s photo library, the  Files app  (and any con fi gured cloud  storage services), or from forScore’s documents directory if you’ve added any images using  File Sharing . First,  fi nd or create a PNG  image (for best results it should be 144 × 144 pixels), then tap the “…” button in the top left-hand corner of the panel and choose  the appropriate source and select your image(s). On iPad or Mac, you can drag and drop an image from virtually any app directly  into the stamp creator and edit it as needed before saving.  Tip: The “Browse Images” interface allows you to delete images you no longer need: swipe from left to right over the item in the list and tap the delete action to con fi rm.  If you use particular stamps more often than others, you can rearrange them as needed. Tap and hold a stamp for a moment, then  drag it around on the screen, and the others will move out of the way. You can also delete a stamp by selecting it and then tapping  the trash can button at the bottom of the panel.

Tap a drawing preset once to select it,  then tap again to edit it  Tap within the selected area to show or  hide the action popup  Tap to choose the selection tool, tap  again to change its selection style  Drawing Presets  Drawing presets allow you to create an unlimited number of di ff erent styles perfectly tailored to  your needs. Tap the + button to create a new preset, or edit any existing preset by tapping it  once to select it and then tapping again to show the editor. You can adjust the hue, saturation,  transparency, brightness, size, and overlay mode for each preset. Use the buttons in the toolbar  along the bottom of the editor to delete or duplicate your preset. To reorder your presets, close  the editor and tap and hold to drag a preset left or right.  Ruler  When you need to draw straight lines or precisely align your stamps and shapes, the ruler tool is  ready to help. Just tap the ruler icon to show or hide it. Reposition it by dragging it around on  the page, or rotate it by placing two  fi ngers within the ruler and spinning them clockwise or  counter-clockwise: as you do, a dot will appear showing you the current angle. When you get  close to a right or diagonal angle, the dot will turn blue and the ruler will snap to that value.  Place your  fi nger near either edge of the ruler to draw a straight line or to position your stamp  or shape along it. If you start drawing further away from the ruler and draw into it, your  markings will stop at the edge.  Selection Tool  The selection tool allows you to edit a speci fi c area of drawn annotations after they’ve been  made (including stamps and shapes). Draw around the annotations you want to edit and you’ll  see several new actions appear in a dark popup near your selection. The move tool, active by  default, lets you reposition your annotations: drag your selection around on the page, then tap  outside of it to commit your changes or tap within the selected area to continue editing it.  You can also choose from one of the other  fi ve actions: Duplicate, Copy, Cut, Adjust, and Clear.  The duplicate action creates a copy of your drawings that you can then drag to reposition, Clear  erases the selected area, and Cut combines the Copy and Clear actions.  Copy saves the currently selected drawings and lets you paste them on another page, even in  another  fi le. With the selection tool active, tap to place the copied drawings onto the page  (drag to reposition if needed or tap the arrow button to use the copy’s original position).  The Adjust action lets you re-color your annotations by changing their hue, saturation,  brightness, and opacity.  Text Annotations  Text annotations can be used to display text directly on a page at all times. With the text tool  selected, tap the page to create a new text box. Drag the white circle on the left side of it to  move it, and drag the one on the right to change its width (forScore automatically adjusts its height to show all of its text).  When you tap inside of a text box to edit it, you’ll also be able to adjust its style (and set defaults for new text boxes), assign it to  another layer, or delete it. On iOS and iPadOS, these actions are available in the toolbar that appears at the top of the virtual  keyboard, if shown, or along the bottom of the screen if not (the system hides the virtual keyboard when a physical keyboard or  certain page turning devices  are connected). On macOS, tap the ellipsis button to the right of the active text box to access these  options. When you’re done editing, tap the page outside of the text area to dismiss the keyboard.  Layers  Use layers to separate your annotations, allowing you to work with one set of markings without a ff ecting any other. The Layers  panel lets you view and manage layers, pick the active layer, and reorder, hide, duplicate, clear, or combine them. Score layers are

Logitech’s Crayon stylus is based on Apple  Pencil technology and works similarly; the  instructions in this guide apply equally to  each accessory except where noted  available on every page of the current score and can be hidden or shown for all pages at once.  You can also copy the entire contents of a layer and paste them atop or replace the contents of another layer, even on a di ff erent  page or score. In the layers panel, tap and hold a layer to access these and other actions using its contextual menu.  forScore Pro subscribers have access to an additional “PDF” layer that allows them to copy and paste page contents and make  structural changes to their documents. Learn more about this feature in the  forScore Pro  section of this guide.  Apple Pencil (iPad only)  When you’re using Apple Pencil, forScore gives you additional options that allow you to work  more naturally. “Automatically enter annotation mode” activates the drawing tools the moment  Apple Pencil touches the screen, and “automatically exit annotation mode” saves your changes  after a brief period of inactivity. We refer to these settings collectively as “instant annotation.”  Although iOS and Apple Pencil work together to avoid unintentional input, no system is perfect.  If you don’t plan to annotate by drawing with your  fi ngers, enabling “prevent  fi nger drawing”  may help. You’ll still be able to use your  fi ngers to do things like change tools or zoom in, but  only Apple Pencil will draw. If Apple Pencil hasn’t been used for a while, or if you tap the hand  icon in the annotation toolbar,  fi nger drawing will be re-enabled.  Newer Apple Pencil models support squeeze/tap gestures which can be used to switch tools,  show the current tool’s detail view, and more (con fi gurable in the Settings app). If you prefer to  be able to switch tools even when annotation mode is inactive, change the “switch tools”  option in the Apple Pencil section of forScore’s settings panel. Otherwise, this gesture can  optionally be con fi gured for use outside of annotation mode using the instructions found in the  Page Turners & Shortcuts  section of this guide.  If Apple’s Scribble feature is enabled on your device, you can use Apple Pencil to hand-write  words directly into a text annotation and iPadOS will transform them into text automatically.  Newer iPads support hover detection, allowing forScore to show a drawing preview before your  pencil touches the screen. This can be customized, along with additional options available to  forScore Pro subscribers (see the forScore Pro section for more information).  Sidebar  If the sidebar is visible and presented in tiled mode, that space is repurposed when annotation  mode is activated. The Layers list is shown here by default, but can be replaced by the Stamps  or Shapes panels by tapping either of these tools once to select them, if needed, then tapping  them a second time. Note that you can continue to use other tools or presets while these detail views are embedded in the sidebar.  Note: forScore’s split view layout and the sidebar are always available on macOS, and can be optionally enabled using the  Display Options  interface on supported iPads  (devices running iPadOS 16 that support Apple’s Stage Manager feature). The sidebar is not available on other devices.  Settings  forScore also includes several settings that give you more control over how annotation mode saves your last-used tool or preset. By  default, the last tool you used remains selected the next time you enter annotation mode. In forScore’s settings panel, the  “Annotation Tools” section allows you to change this: either choose which tools can be saved between annotation sessions and  which should not, or pick a default drawing preset that will be active each time you start annotating.  As you draw, lines can become bolder to capture your natural emphasis (this is based on pressure and tilt with Apple Pencil, tilt  with Logitech Crayon, or drawing speed when you’re using your  fi nger). Use additional options in the settings panel to control how  pronounced this variable width e ff ect is.

Customize the size of links and buttons in  the Accessibility section of forScore’s  settings panel to better suit your needs.  Tap and hold a button to edit it  Links & Buttons  Links  Create a link between two points in your score to handle repeats with a single tap or click. Every  link that you create consists of two components: a blue circle and an orange circle (an activation  point and a target point). Blue circles are visible on the page at all times and take you to their  destination when tapped. When you arrive, the corresponding orange circle  fl ashes twice,  showing you where to begin playing, but remains invisible the rest of the time.  Note: Links don’t have to be on di ff erent pages, they can also be used as visual cues on the same page. If needed, the page  scrolls up or down to the correct position.  To create a link, select “Links” from the tools menu, and you’ll see a new screen appear with two  copies of the current score displayed side-by-side. Use the seek bar or swipe to  fl ip through the  pages of either stack.  Tap anywhere on the left-hand page to create a blue circle, and tap anywhere on the right-hand  page to create a corresponding orange circle. Both points are required to create a link. If you  need to adjust the placement of a link point, simply tap the screen again in the correct position  and the circle will move.  Tip: Tap and hold the page for a moment and a magnifying glass will pop up just above your  fi nger, letting you position your  links more precisely.  Buttons  Like links, buttons are tappable dots that can be placed anywhere on the page. Unlike links,  however, buttons work alone and can be customized to perform a wide range of actions. They  can open a score or bookmark, send MIDI commands, start or stop the metronome or change  its tempo, control audio track playback, play a pitch, display a text note, and more. Each type of  action is color-coded and can be customized for easy recognition.  Although you set up your button’s action when you create it, you can edit it at any time: just tap  and hold your  fi nger on a button until the editing interface appears.  Editing Links and Buttons  To delete or reposition a link or button, enter annotation mode by choosing “Annotate” from the tools menu or by tapping and  holding the page for a few moments. With the erase tool selected, tap a link or button to remove it. If any other tool selected, links  and buttons will appear as white circles that can be dragged around on the page.  Note that only the blue (source) dot of a link can be edited after creation. If you need to move the orange (destination) dot, you’ll  have to delete the link and recreate it.

Rearrange is available for most PDF  fi les  (DRMed or password-protected  fi les  cannot be modi fi ed)  Rearrange  The Rearrange tool allows you to make structural changes to your documents by merging  several PDF  fi les together or by splitting one into individual parts. Reorder, duplicate, rotate,  insert, or remove pages and save the results as a new  fi le or replace the original.  Editing a Score  While links are a great visual way of dealing with repeats, they still require that you reach up and  tap the screen. Rearranging a score in advance, however, ensures that the next page is always  the correct one—it’s great for musicians who use Autoturn or a foot pedal to turn pages.  While viewing the score you’d like to edit, choose “Rearrange” from the tools menu. Drag pages  around on the screen to reorder them, and use the toolbar along the bottom of each thumbnail  to remove, rotate, or duplicate it, or to create a new section beginning with it (use sections to  split up large  fi les). Tap a page to see a larger version of it, if needed.  To move multiple pages, start to drag one and then tap additional pages with another  fi nger to  collect them into a stack. Move them to your desired location and lift your  fi nger to place them  in the order they were picked up, or tap Cancel to put them back in their original positions.  Adding Pages  While rearranging one  fi le, tap the new + button at the bottom of the screen to add the pages of another score or bookmark to  your workspace. You can also access the Templates feature here to add one or more new pages.  Saving a Score  When you’re done adjusting your score’s layout, tap “Save As…” to create a new  fi le (copying the source  fi le’s metadata and  annotations) or “Save” to permanently overwrite the original  fi le. In both cases, Links and Bookmarks are preserved and updated as  long as their start and end pages haven’t been removed and, in the case of Bookmarks, that they haven’t been reversed (a  bookmark’s start page must come before its end page).  Keep in mind that some  fi les may use special fonts that iOS cannot reproduce. Before overwriting any  fi le, we strongly recommend  that you save a copy  fi rst to ensure that the results are usable.  If you’ve split the  fi le into multiple sections, the “Save” button won’t be available, but you can use the “Save As…” button to create a  set of new, sequentially numbered  fi les.  Tip: Use the “white marker” annotation preset or the rectangle shape to cover up the portions of repeated pages that you don’t need to play again. Since each page  includes its own annotations, you will still be able to see that information on other copies of the page.  Keyboard & Cursor Support  If you’re using a trackpad or mouse, use the shift key to select multiple pages at once: hold down the shift key and click one page,  keep holding the shift key while you click additional pages, then click and drag the stack of pages around on the screen (you can  let go of the shift key at this point). Once you’ve dropped the stack and let go of the shift key, forScore will place your pages in the  target spot. You can also select multiple pages by holding down the shift key while you click and drag to draw a rectangle around  your target pages.

Crop  The Crop tool lets you change how forScore presents each page of music on-screen without  modifying the PDF  fi le itself. Note that cropping or uncropping a page permanently adjusts any  existing drawn annotations you’ve made, so consider  creating a backup  before proceeding.  Basics  Reposition your page by using one  fi nger to drag it around within the canvas or using two  fi ngers (a “pinch” gesture) to zoom in or out. If needed, you can reduce the sensitivity of these  gestures by dragging the slider along the left side of the screen up or down. Use higher speeds  to make big changes, then use lower speeds to make small, precise adjustments. Tap the “x”  button in the bottom toolbar to reset your page’s position and zoom factor, if needed.  To save your changes and close the Crop interface, tap the “Crop” button in the top right-hand  corner of the screen. To save your work and continue cropping nearby pages instead, tap the  arrow buttons in the navigation bar to move to the previous or next page. If a page is already  cropped, you won’t be able to make any additional changes to its position and the “Crop”  button will be replaced with a red “Uncrop” button which you can use to reset all cropping data.  Tap the guide icon (a rectangle with a horizontal line through it) in the toolbar along the bottom of the screen to show or hide the  cropping guide. This guide shows you how your page will look in both portrait and landscape device orientations. Keep in mind  that the landscape guide represents where the page will end up given the current device’s screen size and settings (like whether or  not forScore is con fi gured to show the status bar along the top of the screen). It does not represent every scenario and other  devices may present your pages di ff erently.  Note: cropping overrides the Metadata panel’s margin adjustment value; cropped pages will not zoom in or out based on this setting.  Automatic Positioning  When the Crop tool loads a page, it automatically scans it to  fi nd the best  fi t and repositions your page accordingly. Use the zoom  button in the toolbar to reset to this positioning at any time.  De-skewing Pages  If your page is crooked, use the de-skew controls to straighten it. Tap the rotation icon in the toolbar to show or hide the de-skew  control which appears along the bottom of the page. Drag it left or right to rotate the page clockwise or counter-clockwise. When  you do, a grid appears temporarily to help guide your adjustments.  Editing All Pages Simultaneously  In the toolbar along the bottom of the screen, you’ll see a button that looks like a grid of pages—tap here to crop or uncrop all  pages of the current score simultaneously. Choose “Crop All Pages Automatically” to let forScore scan each page and adjust it to  best  fi t the screen (pages that are already cropped won’t be changed). Or, position the current page as needed and use those  values to crop all uncropped pages in the document by choosing “Crop All Pages Like This.” If any pages in the document are  already cropped, choose “Uncrop All Pages” to uncrop them all.  Automatic Backups  Each time you open the Crop interface and make one or more changes (cropping or uncropping one or more pages), forScore  makes an automatic backup of the current score and places it in the “Recently Updated” section of forScore’s Backups panel. If you  want to revert to this last-saved state, close the Crop interface, open forScore’s Tools menu and choose Backups, then visit this  section to see a list of scores. Tap your score to return it to your library, either as a second copy (“Keep Both”) or replacing the  current copy (“Restore Original”). Note that forScore keeps only the most recent snapshot of a score, and recycles it after seven  days, so it’s important to use this feature immediately after you make a change, if needed.

Keyboard & Cursor Support  forScore’s Crop interface features extensive support for use with keyboards, trackpads, and mice. With the Crop interface open,  hold down the Command key (on an iPad) or open the “Crop” menu (on a Mac) to see most of the available key commands,  including shortcuts for most of the items in the navigation bar and toolbar along the top bottom of the screen.  You can also use a keyboard to adjust the page’s position by using the bracket keys (‘[‘ and ‘]’) to zoom in or out, the bracket and alt  keys to rotate, and the arrow keys to nudge the page in any cardinal direction. Press these keys or key combinations once or press  and hold them down to repeat the action as many times as necessary. Use the shift key with any of these commands to increase  their adjustment rate.  Place two  fi ngers on your trackpad and use pinch or pan (scroll) gestures to zoom in or out and reposition the page on screen (note  that not all trackpads support these gestures). If these gestures are unavailable or you prefer not to use them, click and drag the  page to reposition it instead, and use key commands to zoom in or out.  Note that the speed adjustment slider on the left side of the screen reduces the sensitivity of touch as well as cursor gestures  (scrolling or panning) but does not a ff ect the speed of adjustments made using keyboard shortcuts.

Store  It can be hard to  fi nd high-quality scores online that don’t force you into using proprietary  systems or limited formats, which is why we created forScore’s in-app purchase storefront. It’s a  great place to  fi nd and download PDF sheet music that has been perfectly optimized for iOS.  Choose “store” from the tools menu to view the storefront. You’ll  fi nd both free and paid scores  and collections, articles on a variety of topics, news, some of our other apps, and links to a few  of our favorite accessories.  Purchasing and Downloading  Your Apple ID is your gateway to purchasing digital content, so you don’t need to worry about  entering your credit card information directly into the app. Tap any product to learn more and  purchase or re-download it.  Content begins downloading immediately once your transaction has  fi nished processing. You  can monitor its progress from the product page or by tapping “My Purchases” in the top left-  hand corner of the main store view.  Purchase History  Tap the bag icon at the top of the main store view or choose “in-app purchases” from forScore’s settings panel to view all of your  past purchases. Tap any item to re-download it, even if it’s no longer available for sale.  If items aren’t appearing in the list, tap “Restore” (and sign in with your account if prompted) to refresh your purchase history.  Tap the list icon to sort your purchases by date or title, and tap the download button in the toolbar to download all of your  purchases at once.  Migration  Although we no longer sell third-party content through our storefront, items you previously purchased can still be downloaded if  needed. Some of these items may have used copy protection to limit how you can use or share them. If you’re migrating to a new  device, these items may be inaccessible until you re-download them using forScore’s purchase history panel.  All of the content we currently sell directly to our customers is DRM-free and can be migrated from one device to another without  any limitations.

forScore Pro  Features  forScore Pro is an optional, auto-renewing subscription that allows us to o ff er more advanced  features, ensures we can be ready for the latest devices, accessories, and software updates on  day one, and gives you access to certain features and bene fi ts like the ones described below  (the exact list is subject to change; for the most current information visit  forScore.co/pro ).  Face Gestures:  If your device supports face tracking, you can use facial gestures to turn pages—by turning  your head, by winking, or by moving your lips to the left or right. Choose whichever mode  works best for you and adjust its sensitivity in the forScore Pro section of forScore’s settings  panel, if needed. For best results, ensure that there’s su ffi cient lighting and, if using mouth movements, take advantage of the  automatic calibration method for easy setup.  Pop-up Menus:  Many of the buttons in forScore’s navigation bar feature pop-up menus to let you quickly perform common tasks related to each of  them. Touch the button and drag your  fi nger downward to see the list of shortcuts, or tap and hold an item until the menu  appears.  While in annotation mode, use pop-up menus to switch between layers or adjust the size of any drawing preset as well as the  stamps, shapes, and eraser tools.  Note: when using a mouse or trackpad, right clicking any of these buttons will immediately present its pop-up menu. You can also click and drag downward to show the  menu, but due to con fl icts in the way iPadOS and macOS handle Drag and Drop this will not work for buttons that also support rearranging (annotation drawing presets).  Page Copy & Paste:  Each page has a single annotation layer by default, but forScore Pro subscribers will also see an additional “PDF” layer at the top of  the Layers list for every page of a score. This layer works much like other layers do, but with one important distinction: when you  use the selection tool’s Copy or Cut actions, forScore copies any annotations on that layer as well as the contents of the page itself.  This allows you to move measures around or copy and paste them between pages to better suit your needs. Learn more about the  selection tool in the  Annotation  section of this guide, or see  this knowledge base article  for step-by-step instructions.  If you’re a forScore Pro subscriber and you make structural edits to a document, you can share those changes with colleagues—  either send an annotated PDF  fi le with permanently embedded annotations, or share a 4SC  fi le (the receiver can show, hide, or  clear the PDF layer but can not make any changes of their own).  Note: forScore cannot copy vector information stored within a PDF  fi le, it can only copy a high-resolution image of the selected portion of a page. If you’re working with  vector-based  fi les (which can be enlarged without limit), changes made using Page Copy & Paste will appear pixelated at higher zoom levels. Whenever possible,  permanent or archival changes should be made using the same source material and application that was used to create the original PDF  fi le in the  fi rst place.  Stamps & Symbols:  Swipe left and right in the Stamps palette to access six additional stamp sets (almost 400 additional symbols) and use them as is or  copy any of them to your personal collection to edit or reorder them. Pro users can also create stamps using Apple’s SF Symbols  library—just  fi nd a symbol using the  SF Symbols app  and type in its name to add it to your stamp collection. That gives you access  to over 6,000 symbols as of iOS 18 and any that are added with future OS updates.  SF Symbols can be used for more than just stamps: open the metadata panel and tap a metadata category to customize it. In  addition to the symbols o ff ered there by default, Pro users can add any other SF Symbol by name to perfectly personalize their  organizational system.  Apple Pencil:

On supported devices, while holding Apple Pencil near the screen, you can use customizable pinch, swipe, and tap gestures to  resize or cycle through presets, undo or redo drawings, or show a rotary preset picker that makes accessing your presets faster and  easier than ever. With Apple Pencil Pro, you can even con fi gure the squeeze gesture to show this rotary picker for instant access  with one hand.  Pro fi les:  Create multiple settings pro fi les for separate forScore users or customize your forScore experience for any situation. When you  switch back and forth between pro fi les they’re updated and restored automatically.  Sharing:  When sharing scores, bookmarks, or setlists, an additional “automation” option allows you to easily copy the relevant URL so you  can save it wherever you like.  App Icons:  Customize your home screen by choosing from additional app icon options.  Subscribing  Choose Settings from forScore’s tools menu and select “forScore Pro” to learn more, subscribe, access settings for subscriber-only  features, and restore or manage an existing subscription.  Note: if you’re currently subscribed to forScore Pro and you start using forScore on a new device, you may need to use the Restore button found within this panel to start  using your membership on that device—your original device(s) will still be able to use forScore Pro.  If you choose to become a forScore Pro subscriber, you’ll not only be getting the bene fi ts outlined above: you’ll also be supporting  us and making sure we can keep releasing updates for years to come. After the  fi rst year, Apple takes a smaller cut so more of your  money goes directly to supporting our app.  And if you’re perfectly happy with forScore just the way it is, there’s no pressure to become a subscriber. No existing features  require any further payment, so you can use them forever. If your needs grow, we’ll be ready to serve them.  Complete terms of service are available at  forScore.co/terms-of-service  and our privacy policy can be found at  forScore.co/privacy .  forScore Pro Pass  With forScore 14 we introduced a forScore Pro 30-day pass that unlocks all forScore Pro features for 30 days with no auto-renewal.  Although a forScore Pro subscription is more cost-e ff ective, this pass gives you an opportunity to try these features so you can  decide if subscribing is right for you.

Services  The Services panel lets you work with  fi les stored in cloud storage services (like  Dropbox  and  Box ), to access the system’s  fi le  browser, and to download your purchases from content providers (like  Musicnotes ,  Note fl ight ,  Virtual Sheet Music , and  more ).  Cloud Storage  Tap the + button to add your preferred cloud service to the accounts list, then select it and log in when prompted. Once you’ve  done so, you can navigate through your folders and see your  fi les. You can upload, download, move, and delete supported  fi le  types including PDFs, forScore-speci fi c formats (4SC, 4SS, and 4SB), audio  fi les, comma-separated value (CSV)  fi les, and some text  formats (TXT, RTF, DOC, and DOCX) which are automatically converted to PDFs for you once downloaded.  Tap on a  fi le to download it and a copy will be saved to your forScore library. If a  fi le with the same name already exists, you’ll be  asked to duplicate or overwrite the  fi le, or to cancel the transfer. Tap the stop button in the middle of the progress wheel to cancel  a  fi le transfer. Swipe from right to left over an item (or tap and hold to reveal its contextual menu, if using a system version that  supports them) to download the item directly into a setlist.  Items you add to your library are downloaded to your device so you don’t need an internet connection to view them. If the copy stored in the cloud is modi fi ed later, you’ll  need to re-download it to see those changes.  You can also move your  fi les: while in edit mode, tap to select one or more  fi les, then tap the tray icon in the toolbar. The selected  fi les will turn blue, and you’ll be able to select directories or use the back button to navigate to the desired destination. When  you’re ready, tap the “Move” button once again to send the selected  fi les to the current directory.  To upload  fi les, tap the + button in the toolbar to select the item(s) you’d like to upload. Use the tab bar along the bottom to switch  between content types. If you’re sharing scores, bookmarks, or setlists, you’ll be presented with forScore’s sharing interface so you  can choose which format to use and take advantage of other sharing options like restrictions or speci fi c page ranges.  Files (iCloud Drive) and Other Services  The Services panel can also be used to access iCloud Drive and third-party cloud storage (including Google Drive, Microsoft  OneDrive, Amazon Drive, as well as FTP, SFTP, or WebDAV servers) through a system-provided interface. Visit  The Files App  section  later in this guide for more information.  Tip: The Files interface that appears when you use the Services panel is also available from forScore’s main menu (tap the import button). In general, that’s an easier way of  adding scores or other  fi les to your forScore library.  Content Providers  Purchases you’ve made using supported content providers are listed by title and composer (or primary performer) and can be  sorted alphabetically by either value, by date purchased, or by key. Tap any item to download it as a standard PDF  fi le, or swipe  over an item from right to left and use the Download action to download it to a speci fi c setlist (or tap and hold to use contextual  menus, if available). Tap “Edit” to select multiple  fi les and download them all simultaneously.  If a content provider supports downloading transposed PDFs, you’ll see an ellipsis button to the right of that item. Tap here to see a  list of available keys and choose which one you’d like to download.  While viewing a list of purchases, tap the gear icon in the toolbar to enable or disable automatic downloads for that folder. After  enabling this feature, any purchases that become available in this location will be automatically downloaded into your library as  soon as they’re discovered by forScore.  Account Management  To log out of an account or reset its authentication status, return to the accounts list and swipe over it from right to left, then  choose Log Out (for content providers) or Delete (for cloud storage services).

Scan  When you need to digitize a paper score, Scan can help. Snap a photo of each page with your  device’s camera or add a few images from your Photos library. Adjust your pages if needed, then  let Scan turn them into a standard PDF  fi le.  While Scan is great for quickly capturing scores, a  fl atbed scanner is recommended for archival digitization.  Getting Started  Add pages from a variety of sources shown as icons at the top of the screen. Take pictures using  the document scanner or camera (if supported by your device), import images from your  device’s photo library or the Files app, or browse for images you’ve already added to forScore’s  Documents directory. Tap the circled + button in the page view to add another page with  whichever source you used last.  Scan requires access to your device’s camera and/or photo library and the system will prompt you to allow this the  fi rst time  you try to add images. Use your OS’ settings (the Settings app on iOS and iPadOS or System Settings on Mac) to grant or  revoke this access at any time.  The document scanning method is easiest to use: point your camera at a page and the system will attempt to  fi nd the edges  automatically, then snap a photo when it’s ready. If you prefer, you can take the photo manually instead. Use this system interface  to apply  fi lters and use its built-in cropping and rotation functions to make any necessary adjustments. When you’re  fi nished, tap  Done and the system will hand those photos o ff  to forScore to continue processing.  iOS’ Document Scanning interface limits the number of images you can capture in one session. To add more images, tap this interface’s “save” button to close it and add the  current batch of images to forScore’s grid view, then tap the + button or the document scanning icon to repeat the process as many times as needed.  When using the camera input source, take each photo and tap “Done” when you’re  fi nished. When adding images from your photo  library, tap to select each image you’d like to use, then tap Cancel when you’re  fi nished. (This system interface can’t be changed,  but don’t worry: tapping cancel just ends the import process and doesn’t remove any of the photos you’ve already chosen.)  Page Layout  Once you’ve returned to forScore’s Scan interface, you’ll see a grid of thumbnail images. Drag these thumbnails around to adjust  your layout, or tap on one to see a larger version of it and make any necessary adjustments. If you need to remove an image, tap  the blue circled “x” in the top left-hand corner of each thumbnail. When you’re done, tap the “Save” button and supply a  fi lename  to create your new PDF.  Rotating Images  While viewing a full-screen image preview, use the arrow buttons in the top right-hand corner of the screen to rotate your image  90° at a time. You can also rotate images from the main thumbnail view by placing two  fi ngers on a page and rotating them.  Adjusting Images  Scan’s Enhance tool analyzes your photo and applies a set of  fi lters to give you much better results with just a single tap. It adjusts  the tone, highlights, and shadows of your image automatically and intelligently. For more  fi ne-grained control, use the Adjust tool  to manually change your image’s saturation, contrast, and brightness levels. These tools are available from the main thumbnail  view and in each full-screen preview, so you can use them to adjust a single image or all images at once.  Cropping  Perfectly framing your shot can be tricky, but with the Crop tool you don’t have to. While viewing a full-screen image preview,  select the Crop icon to begin and forScore will attempt to automatically detect the edges of your page. Drag the handles to  perfectly align each corner—they move independently of each other, allowing you to account for perspective and rotation while  removing excess margins.

Cue  Our remote control system, Cue, allows you connect multiple devices together wirelessly to coordinate your page turns and  program changes. It uses both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to discover and communicate with nearby devices, and performance may vary  based on environmental factors.  Note: Although Wi-Fi must be enabled for the app to discover nearby devices, an internet connection is not required when using Cue.  Roles  In order to properly coordinate your actions, Cue requires you to pick a role when initiating or joining a session. A “Leader” is  responsible for turning pages and navigating between di ff erent scores or bookmarks in their library. A “Follower” lets their device  follow along automatically, either by responding to page turns, program changes, or both.  Note: A Program Change is how we refer to navigation between songs. When a leader opens a new score or bookmark from their library or  fl ips from the end of one piece  to the beginning of the next, that’s a Program Change.  Tap the Cue icon in the  Display Options overlay  to choose your role: “Lead,” “Follow Page Turns,” “Follow Program Changes,” “Follow  Both,” or pick “Dual Page mode” (discussed later in this section). Tap “open panel” or select Cue from the Tools menu to open the  Cue connection panel which lists available and connected devices and lets you change your role or disconnect from the current  session.  Device-Speci fi c Considerations  Page turns work di ff erently depending on your device’s orientation and settings. If a leader is using their device in landscape  orientation, forScore will send page up and down messages but only other landscape-oriented devices will respond. Similarly, half-  page turn messages can be sent by a leader who uses them, and only the connected devices who are using portrait mode and who  have half-page turns enabled will see the e ff ect.  Dual Page Mode  When using forScore on one device and the standalone Cue app on another, a special Dual Page mode lets you view two full pages  side-by-side. One page appears on the primary device, and Cue displays the next page wirelessly. Tap or swipe on either screen to  advance, two pages at a time. Links and buttons are also supported on either screen, so you don’t have to worry about which  device you need to tap.  The standalone  Cue app  is currently available on the App Store worldwide.  Cue 2  With forScore 14.4 we introduced a new version of the Cue remote control protocol called Cue 2 which uses Apple’s modern  networking frameworks to provide faster and more reliable connections. Cue 2 is compatible with forScore 14.4 or later and the  standalone Cue app (version 2.4 or later). You can switch back to the original Cue 1 protocol if needed to connect to devices  running older versions of either app: tap the circled ellipsis button in the top left-hand corner of the Cue panel to switch between  protocol versions.

Dashboard  If you allow it, forScore can track which scores, bookmarks, and setlists you view and for how  long. With this information collected, the Dashboard feature in the tools menu can give you  valuable insights into your playing habits and helps keep you on track. Three tabs along the top  or bottom of the screen (shown on the left of the screen in a sidebar when space allows) give  you di ff erent ways of viewing and using this information:  Analytics  The Analytics tab shows information collected over the past ninety days. It can show you  statistics for either items (scores and bookmarks) or setlists, and displays either the total amount  of time you spent playing or the number of views.  Tap on any day to see a detailed list of items or setlists in the lower portion of the screen. This  list shows everything you viewed on that particular day and is sorted from most played or  viewed to least. You can tap on any item or setlist in this list to see how often you’ve viewed or  played it over the past ninety days.  Goals  The Goals tab helps you reach a minimum number of views or amount of play time for each day, week, month, or all time. Goals  can be item- or setlist-speci fi c, or they can be more general.  The main list of goals shows your current progress as a circular view and, if your goal is time-speci fi c, uses an additional view in the  lower left-hand corner to show your results for the previous term. For instance, a weekly goal would prominently display this  week’s progress with a smaller view for last week’s results.  Tap a goal to edit it or to view your results for the past ninety days. The timeline along the top of the screen shows your results for  the past ninety days: tap on any of these graphics to share your progress with friends or colleagues via email, message, Twitter,  Facebook, and more. It’s a great way to hold yourself accountable or to share your success.  Reports  The Reports tab lets you periodically share more detailed information with a colleague or instructor as a PDF document. To begin,  create a new report template and tap the circled arrow button to edit it.  Here, you can customize your report to display progress for all items and/or setlists or for one in particular. Select day, week, or  month, and choose how far back you’d like the report to go. Once you’re done, tap the back button and tap the report to view its  results and use the action button in the top right-hand corner to share it.  Note: The information forScore collects is stored locally on your device. It doesn’t get sent to any servers, and won’t be shared with anyone unless you speci fi cally choose to  do so. Visit  forscore.co/privacy  to learn more.

Page Turners & Shortcuts  Accessories  forScore works with a variety of accessories, including page turners, keyboards, MIDI devices, and styluses. Most MIDI devices and  certain page turners can be connected using a cable (and usually an adapter such as Apple’s USB adapters or the  iRig MIDI ).  Most other accessories use Bluetooth and can be connected to your iOS device through the Settings app, or through System  Preferences on a Mac. Several speci fi c devices can also connect directly to forScore through the Devices section of the app’s  settings panel: these include AirTurn’s page turning devices that use the newer “Bluetooth Smart” technology, such as the  PED,  PEDpro, and BT200 series , as well as the  iRig BlueBoard ,  Turn Touch  remote, and devices that support Bluetooth MIDI.  Keyboards  When a typing keyboard is connected to your device, forScore allows you to use a variety of shortcuts to perform common actions  depending on which view you’re working in. In the main view, default shortcuts allow you to turn pages, enter annotation mode,  open most menus, search, work with tabs, and more. Most of forScore’s menus include default shortcuts like search, back, and  dismiss, while other views like the Metronome and Pitch Pipe feature shortcuts for common actions speci fi c to each utility. On  iPadOS or visionOS, press and hold the command key to see an overlay that shows all currently available actions and the key  combination you can use to activate each one.  By default, forScore turns pages when you press the arrow keys, space key, return key, and the page up/page down keys. That’s  because many page turners are actually simpli fi ed keyboards that feature just a few “keys” or pedals and they usually send some  combination of these keystrokes; this con fi guration allows forScore to work with most accessories right out of the box.  Virtual Keyboard  iOS’ virtual keyboard, which normally appears on screen when you need to type, disappears when the system thinks you’re using  an external keyboard—this can prevent you from typing while using certain page turning devices. Some of these accessories  include a hardware workaround to help you with this issue, which you can learn more about  here .  Customization  Most of forScore’s shortcuts can be customized, and you can set up dozens of optional actions using almost any keyboard shortcut,  MIDI command, or other supported accessory input. Open forScore’s Tools menu, choose Settings, then tap “Page Turners &  Shortcuts” to access them all. Where applicable, defaults commands are shown in gray to the right of their associated actions. To  customize an action, tap to highlight it and then activate a control on your external device—if the signals it sends are compatible  with forScore, you’ll see the command appear in blue next to it. Tap the “x” button to remove a custom command.  You can use multiple inputs to trigger the same action: just repeat the process above to assign additional inputs, and a circled  ellipsis button will appear to the right of the cell. Tap on this button to see all assigned inputs and remove one or all of them if  needed.  Note: if a shortcut isn’t being recognized, check that it’s not already assigned to a di ff erent action; if so, you’ll need to remove it from that other action before reassigning it  to a new one. Note that certain signals, like MIDI commands that represent a range of values rather than a simple on/o ff  state, cannot be used in this panel.  Apple Pencil  Newer Apple Pencil models are touch sensitive and can be squeezed or double tapped to perform certain actions depending on  which app you’re using. Apple provides a system setting that indicates how apps should generally behave—in forScore, “Switch  between current tool and eraser” and “switch between current and last used tool” work as stated, while “show color palette” and  “show ink attributes” open the currently selected tool’s options, if applicable. Squeezing Apple Pencil Pro can also be con fi gured to  “show tool palette” which presents a radial tool picker in forScore so you can quickly switch tools.  By default, tool switching actions only work while you’re in annotation mode, but you can adjust this by changing the “switch tools”  option in the Apple Pencil section of forScore’s settings panel (great if you use the instant annotation settings described above).

Otherwise, if you prefer to repurpose the gesture and allow it to perform a di ff erent task whenever annotation mode is  inactive ,  you can assign it to any of the options available in the “Page Turners & Shortcuts” settings panel.  AirPods  You can also  fl ip pages using head turn gestures while wearing one or both AirPods Pro, AirPods 3, or AirPods Max. AirPods  gestures are available beginning with forScore version 12.0.4. They require iOS or iPadOS 14.0 or later, compatible AirPods (a  fi rmware update may be required), and a device that supports motion processing.  To  fl ip pages backward or forward, hold your head still for a moment and then turn to the left or right with a quick and steady  lateral motion (similar in speed and movement to a swipe gesture performed with your  fi nger). Since gestures aren’t relative to  your screen, you can start them from any position: forScore establishes a resting baseline, then waits for horizontal movement in  either direction to determine when you’re trying to turn pages.  Note: AirPods gestures are not customizable and can only be used to turn pages; they do not function as inputs in the “Page Turners & Shortcuts” settings panel.  To set up AirPods gestures for the  fi rst time, open the Tools menu and choose Settings › Devices › AirPods, then enable gestures  and, if prompted, allow forScore to access Motion & Fitness data to use this feature.  Once this is done, any time AirPods are active and connected to your device you’ll see the AirPods icon in the  Display Options  overlay  where you can toggle these gestures per-window.

Accessibility  forScore includes several Accessibility options in the settings panel that can help you get more out of the app.  Re fl ow  Although forScore can’t interpret the notes in a PDF  fi le, it can detect where important information is generally on each page. With  Re fl ow, forScore takes that information, magni fi es and redraws it, then lays it out end-to-end so you can read your music in one  long line—like a horizontal teleprompter. Re fl ow gets you most of the way there with its smart detection, and if it gets something  wrong you can correct it quickly and never worry about it again.  Re fl ow is available by default on iPhone but on other devices it must  fi rst be enabled for use through the ‘Accessibility’ section of  forScore’s settings panel. To activate it, select the Re fl ow (zig-zag arrow) icon from the  Display Options overlay .  Re fl ow mode features several buttons along the top of the screen: Edit, zoom, navigation mode, and an exit button. Learn about  each of their functions below.  Editing Zones:  The Edit button allows you to adjust Re fl ow’s zones if needed. You’ll see them as gray rectangles—tap once to see its resize  controls, and tap again to show the delete option. Drag the green control at the top of each rectangle to downward to split it  horizontally into two new areas.  You’ll see a control bar along the bottom of the screen: use the + button at the bottom of the screen to create a new zone, use the  arrows to move between pages, and drag the set of three lines on either end of the control bar to drag it up or down and out of  your way. If you’d like forScore to reset all zones and re-scan the page, tap the Reset button.  Zoom:  Zoom in or out to  fi nd the best magni fi cation for you—up to three times as large as the original page.  Navigation:  Choose to page or scroll through your music. In Page mode, tapping on either side of the screen will shift the music over by half of  your screen’s width. In Scroll mode, your music will scroll by continuously: tap the left side of the screen repeatedly to slow it down  or the right side to speed it up. Tap in the center of the screen to pause or resume scrolling.  More  Other Accessibility settings allow you to disable Drag & Drop and Contextual Menu gestures,  change the metronome’s sounds ,  adjust the default size of links and buttons, or use full-screen menus.

The Files App  On iOS and iPadOS devices, Apple provides a standard system interface that any app can use to help you work with documents,  also available through the standalone “Files” app. It lets you access and work with your documents whether they’re stored in iCloud  Drive, third party cloud storage services, or within apps like forScore that choose to make their documents available in this way.  File Providers  The Files interface lets you access documents stored in iCloud Drive, other apps, or dozens of third-party cloud storage services like  Google Drive or Dropbox. Learn more about con fi guring the Files interface to work with your favorite cloud storage provider at  forscore.co/ fi les .  Importing Files  Use the import button in the main menu to copy  fi les to your forScore library. Tap a single  fi le or use the Select button (only  available in the Browse tab) to import multiple  fi les at once. Use the Locations sidebar to switch between cloud storage providers,  including iCloud Drive, or to view  fi les stored locally on your device.  Sharing Files  Any time you share  fi les from forScore, you’ll see iOS’ native sharing interface appear which includes an option called “Save to Files.”  Use this action to copy your  fi les to other apps or upload them to any of the cloud storage services you’ve con fi gured.  On iPads, Drag and Drop gestures make importing and sharing content even easier, especially when using iOS’ multitasking modes. Learn more about these gestures in the  Drag and Drop  section at the end of this guide.  The Services Panel  If you prefer, you can also access the Files interface using forScore’s Services panel. If it’s not already shown in the list of Services,  tap the + button to select it, then tap it to view the splash screen and choose to either upload or download content.  forScore’s Documents  Every app has its own Documents directory where they can store a user’s information. This is where forScore stores all of your PDF  fi les; if you’ve ever used the  File Sharing  interface, this is the directory you were working with.  forScore’s Documents directory can also be accessed directly through the Files interface and standalone app. Choose “On My iPad”  (or iPhone) from the Locations list in the app’s sidebar to see app folders for forScore and any other apps on your device that store  data in their own Documents directories.  Working within forScore’s Documents directory through the Files app carries the same implications as working within the File  Sharing interface does—delete  fi les here and they’ll be permanently removed from forScore. We do not recommend renaming PDF  fi les through this interface as doing so will remove that  fi le’s metadata, annotations, and more.  Note: If you want to rename PDF  fi les stored in forScore’s Documents directory, use the metadata panel to change its title instead and the  fi lename will be updated to  match it as closely as possible.

iCloud Syncing  With iCloud Syncing, forScore can automatically keep your sheet music library up to date across all of your devices.  Setup  To set up syncing, start with your device that contains the most complete and up-to-date music library. Choose Sync from the Tools  menu and tap “Sync with iCloud” to enable it. Next, you’ll have to choose how to handle con fl icts with any data already on the  server, if applicable: in general, you should choose “Prefer Device Versions” on your primary device, and choose “Prefer iCloud  Versions” from other devices that may not yet contain complete copies of your library.  Once you’ve completed syncing from your primary device, repeat these steps on your other devices. Note that your choice to  prefer device or iCloud versions of your data is only necessary when enabling syncing—from then on, forScore has enough  information to resolve con fl icts automatically.  Syncing Content  Syncing happens automatically as you make changes to your library and as e ffi ciently as possible depending on your connection  type, server availability, and other factors. Changes are typically synced in less than a minute but may be delayed in some cases; to  request that forScore begin syncing immediately, open the Sync panel and drag the view downward until the refresh control starts  spinning. Return to this view at any time to see when the last successful sync was completed.  Currently, forScore syncs your music library and content (your sheet music, bookmarks, setlists, metadata, annotations, recordings,  and more). Settings are not synced, however, since many people choose to use slightly di ff erent con fi gurations on di ff erent devices  to get the most out of each form factor. Due to privacy considerations, Dashboard data is not currently synced across devices.  Status & Error Messages  As with any network-dependent service, iCloud Syncing sometimes encounters issues that temporarily prevent it from completing  its work. This is a normal part of the process and usually resolves itself after a short while. In other cases, syncing may not be able to  proceed until you take additional action (in this case you’ll see a red exclamation mark next to the Sync entry in the tools menu).  iCloud Accounts & Storage  forScore uses your personal iCloud account to store its data and keep your content up to date across all devices. For multiple  devices to share the same forScore library, they must be logged into the same iCloud account. This feature does not facilitate  sharing content between di ff erent accounts (even those that use Family Sharing).  Apple’s iCloud service provides di ff erent storage plans, and you will not be able to use forScore’s syncing functionality if your  account does not have su ffi cient storage. iCloud accounts, storage plans, and payments are all handled exclusively by Apple.  Backups  forScore stores its synced documents in iCloud, but in a separate location from Apple’s whole-device backups. If you use iCloud  Backup to back up your device(s) and you also plan to use forScore’s syncing feature, you may not have su ffi cient storage space to  accommodate both. If needed, forScore can indicate to the system that its documents should no longer be included in future  whole-device backups. This increases the risk of data loss, but ensures that only the synced copies of your forScore  fi les exist in  iCloud. In this case, it’s imperative that you  manually back up your data  to a safe, non-synced location in case your data is corrupted  or lost. Once a change is synced across your devices, this is the only way to ensure that you can revert to a previous state.  Privacy  All of your data is stored by Apple using your iCloud account and as such is governed by their policies and terms of service. We do  not maintain user accounts of any kind, and we do not analyze or share your content with any other party at any time.

Backups  Every app on your device has a standard set of folders that it uses to store information. This ‘Documents’ directory is used to store  user content, like documents you add to (or create within) an app. Other data like app settings, which are designed to be changed  through the app’s interface and not edited directly, are stored in a number of private app directories instead.  4SB Backups  In forScore’s Backups panel you can create a forScore Backup (4SB  fi le) that packages all of forScore’s private information into a  single document that is saved alongside the rest of your  fi les in forScore’s Documents directory. Copy all of the  fi les in this directory  (including the 4SB  fi le) to a safe location and you’ll be able to restore forScore back to its current state without a ff ecting any other  apps. As a safeguard, forScore creates an automatic 4SB backup when you launch the app. It keeps the most recent copy and a  copy from the last calendar day you used it.  A backup  fi le can not be used on its own. It only contains forScore’s information about your documents, not copies of your documents themselves. Backups are a good  choice when copying all of your  fi les to a computer using  File Sharing .  4SB Archives  You can also use the Backups panel to create a forScore Archive which is similar to a backup (it also uses the 4SB  fi le extension) but  it includes a copy of every  fi le in forScore’s Documents directory as well. This means that in order to create an archive you need to  have signi fi cantly more free space available on your device, but it can be used to restore your library or migrate to a new device by  copying the single archive  fi le.  An archive  fi le can be used on its own to recover or migrate your forScore library to a new device. They’re great for uploading your library to a cloud storage service for safe  keeping.  forScore Backup Utility  Mac users running macOS 10.14 or later can use the forScore Backup Utility to archive their iOS device’s forScore library directly to  their computer via a USB cable. This can be useful if you want to create a 4SB Archive but don’t have enough free space on your  device. Visit  forScore.co/backup-utility  for more information.  Apple Backups  In most cases, whole-device backups to iCloud or iTunes (depending on your settings) are su ffi cient to get you back up and  running if something happens to your device. The backup techniques described in the sections above are intended to provide an  additional layer of security, not to replace this essential part of protecting your data.  Recently Deleted Files  When you delete a score or setlist using forScore’s delete functions, it is moved to the Recently Deleted section of the Backups  panel. You can recover it for up to seven days or permanently erase it, if needed.  CSV Metadata Import/Export  Tap the scrolled page icon in the top left-hand corner of the Backups panel to import or export your forScore metadata using  standard CSV (comma-separated value) text  fi les. These  fi les are exported using UTF-8 encoding by default, but this can be  adjusted to UTF-16 if needed under Settings › Advanced options › CSV export.

Settings  General  Auto-lock:  Disable this setting to prevent your device from sleeping automatically while forScore is open.

Windows  Multi-window support is a natural part of using a Mac but still a relatively new addition to iPad. Windows give you the freedom to  multitask with ease, letting you switch from one context to another without losing your work or having to remember what you  were just viewing.  Note: multi-window support is only available on macOS and iPadOS. Speci fi c instructions for opening or closing windows can depend on your operating system and  version—please consult Apple’s documentation for complete details.  Primary Window  forScore’s main interface always appears  fi rst. It o ff ers the complete forScore experience, all features described in this guide, and  can be used on its own without any additional windows.  Secondary Windows  While forScore’s primary window gives you complete access to all of the app’s features, secondary windows o ff er a more modern,  streamlined interface built using functionality that wasn’t available when forScore was  fi rst built. Secondary windows are designed  to take full advantage of these features—things like Contextual Menus—and o ff er a unique experience designed around them. In  most cases, secondary windows mimic the core forScore experience and conform to your preferred settings; they work as similarly  to the primary window as possible while o ff ering most of the app’s best functionality.  Secondary windows combine forScore’s many di ff erent windows and panels into a single hierarchy, with a sidebar, menu, and page  view all in one. Swipe inward from the left side of the screen or press the sidebar button in the top left-hand corner of the screen to  access these views.  Sidebar & Search:  The sidebar gives you a high-level view of your library and the integrated search function o ff ers instant access to almost anything  (just like the primary window’s global search function).  Menus:  Menus are presented to the right of the sidebar—their lists can be sorted and their contents can be edited in similar ways as the  primary window using the icons in the navigation bar at the top of the menu or with swipe actions and contextual menus. Menus  also feature a search bar that lets you  fi lter the contents of the list below it.  Page View:  The page view supports similar gestures as the primary window (swipe or tap to turn pages and tap the center of the screen to  show or hide the navigation bar and seek bar). Use the buttons in the navigation bar to edit or share the current score and to  access the  Display Options  interface where you can adjust layout, page turning behavior, sepia mode, performance mode, face  gestures, and more.  External Windows  Much like the older “tv output” setting originally o ff ered for the earliest iPads that didn’t support screen mirroring, external  windows show a copy of the current score in a presentation-friendly way so you can show a page to students, an audience, or to  multiple performers. This type of window is created when toggling the “external display” option in the  Display Options  interface,  shown at all times on macOS and also on iPads whenever an external display is available.

Drag & Drop  Drag and Drop gestures make working with forScore much faster and more intuitive. In most cases Drag and Drop provides a  second way of doing things, so you’re free to use the original way if you prefer.  Basics  To use Drag and Drop on iOS or iPadOS, tap and hold certain items for a moment until they appear to lift o ff  the screen, then drag  your  fi nger away from it slightly to begin the drag process. While holding the item with one  fi nger, you’re free to use your other  fi ngers to interact with forScore or any other app on your device. On macOS, drag and drop works immediately—just click and  drag without pausing  fi rst. Since Macs don’t support multiple simultaneous pointer interactions, some drag and drop techniques  described below may not be practical on macOS.  Note: Contextual Menus also use a long press gesture and change how Drag and Drop works in cases where both are available. Tap and hold an item to show its contextual  menu and then drag the preview away to use Drag and Drop (there’s no need to lift your  fi nger  fi rst, just use one continuous motion). If you prefer, you can disable either  Drag and Drop or Contextual Menus in the Accessibility section of forScore’s settings panel.  In some cases, tapping additional similar items adds them to the drag session (like dragging a score in the Score menu, then  tapping other scores to drag them at the same time). You can open and close menus and panels and your drag items will follow  your  fi nger as long as it’s touching the screen.  When you’ve dragged your  fi nger over a valid drop zone, you may see some indication that lifting your  fi nger here will perform  some kind of action. The drop zone may react by moving or changing colors, or a green “+” badge may appear, for instance, letting  you know that dropping the items in this spot will copy them in some way. Each interaction works a little di ff erently, so try some of  the following examples for yourself to see how they behave.  Rearranging Items  Many of forScore’s views list items that can be rearranged: setlists and their contents, libraries, audio tracks and MIDI commands in  the Metadata panel, accounts in the Services panel, and more. Typically, these items can be arranged by tapping “edit” and then  dragging the three horizontal lines on the right-hand side of the cell up or down as needed. With Drag and Drop, there’s no need to  enter “edit” mode  fi rst—simply tap and hold any part of the item until it lifts up and out of the list, then drag up or down.  Working With Items  Scores and bookmarks can be dragged out of forScore’s Score, Bookmark, and Setlist menus, the Search panel, and you can even  drag the current item out of the main view’s title display (and remember: you can use any combination of these sources to add  multiple items to your drag session). Drag any single item onto the page to open it, or drag one or more items into the Tab bar to  open them in tabs.  Working With Setlists  No feature is better suited to Drag and Drop than Setlists. Creating, editing, and organizing your setlists is dramatically simpler and  faster using these new gestures. To rearrange setlists or their contents, drag items up or down as discussed in the “rearranging  items” section above. You can also drag a setlist into or out of a folder to move it.  To create a new setlist, drop one or more scores or bookmarks into the main Setlists list and supply a name. To add items to an  existing setlist, drop them onto the setlist’s name and they’ll be added to the end of that list. Or, hover over a setlist (or tap it) to  open it, then drop the items into the list at a speci fi c point. You can even drag items out from one setlist and into another one to  copy items between them.  Importing & Sharing Files  Drag and Drop isn’t just restricted to the same app; you can also drag compatible  fi les into forScore to import them. Drop one or  more PDF  fi les into the Score menu to add them to your library, onto the page to import them and open the last one, or drop them  into the tab bar to import and open all of them in new tabs. Drop them into the Setlist menu to create a new setlist with them or

add them to an existing setlist using the same methods described in the previous section.  Importing works with other  fi les, too. Drop any  fi le type supported by forScore into certain views or panels to import them. Other  supported formats include our own 4SC (scores), 4SS (setlists), and 4SB (backups)  fi le types, as well as certain kinds of text and  audio  fi les.  You can also drag some items out of forScore to export them: drag a score to share a copy of its source PDF  fi le, or drag an audio  track, recording, or backup  fi le to copy it to any other app that accepts them.  Audio Tracks  forScore uses Drag and Drop to help you work with audio  fi les more quickly and  fl exibly, too. Drag them into and out of the audio  fi le picker to import or export them, or drag them onto the media box to import them and link them to the current score or  bookmark.  If the current track is a locally stored  fi le, you can drag the track’s title out of the media box to send a copy to another app.  Otherwise, if it’s a track that comes from your device’s shared Music library, you won’t be able to export the  fi le but you can still use  Drag and Drop to add the track to another score or bookmark in your library (drop it into the Metadata panel’s audio track list).  Annotating  While annotating, use Drag and Drop to rearrange your drawing presets by dragging them left or right. You can also work with  images in several ways: drop an image onto the page (from the Photos app, Safari, or any app that allows you to drag images) and  forScore will place it as an annotation. Resize it, reposition it, then tap outside of it to complete the process.  Create new stamps by dragging images from other apps directly into the Stamp Creator’s canvas. Use the Selection tool to select  an area of drawn annotations, then use Drag and Drop to copy them as an image to other apps. Since you’re working with standard  images in both cases, you can even combine these two examples to create new stamps from annotations you’ve previously drawn  by hand, all without leaving the app or needing to go to your computer to deal with image editing software.  Services  In the Services panel, use Drag and Drop to move  fi les between folders or drop certain things here to upload them. Drag scores,  bookmarks, setlists, audio  fi les, backups, or CSV  fi les into the Services panel to upload them.  MIDI  Drag commands between the various MIDI sections in the Metadata panel and the Button editor to copy them, or drag commands  onto the page to create a new button with them.  Multiple Windows  On iPadOS, Drag & Drop gestures can be used to create new windows. Drag a score or setlist to the left or right edge of the screen  until it shows the forScore app icon, then let go to open a new window displaying that content.  Disabling Drag and Drop  Some users may  fi nd that iOS’ Drag and Drop gestures interfere with their ability to work. Although iOS does not currently provide  a system setting to disable them, forScore o ff ers an option in the Accessibility section of its Settings panel called “Drag and Drop”  that signi fi cantly alters how it utilizes these gestures. When this setting is disabled, forScore does not make items available for  dragging and most interactions return to how they worked with older versions of iOS.  Note that this setting does not a ff ect how forScore receives drop gestures originating from other apps, however, so you can still do  things like drag a PDF  fi le from the Files app directly into forScore to import it.

Contextual Menus  On iOS and iPadOS, Contextual Menus combine thumbnail previews, swipe actions, edit mode actions, and Drag and Drop  gestures into one streamlined interaction. On macOS (or when you’re using a pointing device with an iPad) they work just like  normal right-click menus. Just as it does with Drag and Drop gestures, forScore leverages Contextual Menus to make many of its  existing features more accessible, discoverable, and quicker to use.  Basics  If you’re using your  fi nger, a long press (or tap and hold) gesture opens a contextual menu whenever one is available, along with a  content preview when applicable. Tap to choose any of the available actions, or tap away to dismiss it. If you’re using a pointing  device, right click instead to open a contextual menu; note that in this case Apple does not provide any previews but menus  otherwise work the same way.  Scores & Bookmarks  A great place to use contextual menus is when you’re working with scores and bookmarks in list views like the main score,  bookmark, and setlist menus, the search panel, and within item pickers used throughout the app. Tap and hold an item to see a  preview of it and discover all of the actions that are currently available: common actions include opening an item in a new tab,  sharing it, or deleting it. In most cases, you can also tap the preview image to either open or select it depending on the context.  Setlists  When working with setlists, use contextual menus to share, duplicate, move, delete, or open them in a new tab. The move item, in  particular, uses nested menus to give you more granular options: tap “move” then choose from “to top” or “to bottom.”  Multiple Selection  In menus that support multiple item selection through edit mode, contextual menus can be used to work with all selected items at  once. Tap “Edit” to activate edit mode, select two or more items, then tap and hold or right click on any one of them to see which  options are available for all of those items.  More  In forScore’s main view, the title bar’s central display area includes a contextual menu that lets you work with the current score. You  can also right click on any open tab to work with that tab’s item, or anywhere on the page to access additional common actions  (due to con fl icts with existing tap-and-hold gestures, these last two menus are not available using touch).  While in annotation mode, use contextual menus to duplicate or delete drawing presets and to copy, paste, replace, clear, or delete  annotation layers. In the tools menu, contextual menus are available for many (though not all) items in the list. If there’s a tool you  haven’t used yet or want to know more about, tap and hold it then choose “learn more.”  Other places you can use contextual menus include the Services panel, libraries menu, backups panel, storefront, and Dashboard.  Tap and hold items within these views to see all of their available actions.  Mac Menus  On macOS, contextual menus in forScore work just like other “right click” menus. They do not provide previews or icons but  otherwise replicate the same functionality as described above.  Disabling Contextual Menus  If you  fi nd that contextual menus aren’t helpful, or if they interfere with Drag & Drop gestures, you can disable some of these  interactions by visiting the Accessibility section of forScore’s settings panel.
